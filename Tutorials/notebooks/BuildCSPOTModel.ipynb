Briefly, the function takes in the single-cell table (`spatialTablePath`) with X and Y coordinates, the full image (`imagePath`) and lastly a list of `markers` for which thumbnails need to be generated. Please note as the program does not know which channels in the image corresponds to the `markers`, hence, the `markerChannelMapPath` is used to supply a `.csv` file that maps the channels to the marker information. The `markerChannelMap` follow 1-indexing convention- so the first channel is represented by the number `1`. \n",

    "You would have also notices that I have set `maxThumbnails=100`. This basically means that even if more than 100 cells are identified, only 100 random cells will be used to generate the thumbnails. I generally generate about `2000` cells, however based on our estimates about 250 postive and 250 negative examples should be suffcient. As this is for illustration purpose only, I have set it to `100`.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Now that the thumbnails are generated, one would manually go through the `TruePos` folder and `TrueNeg` folder and move files around as necessary. If there are any truly negative thumbnails in the `TruePos` folder, move it to `PosToNeg` folder. Similarly, if there are any truly positive thumbnails in `TrueNeg` folder, move it to `NegToPos` folder. You will often notice that imaging artifacts are captured in the `TruePos` folder and there will also likely be a number of true positives in the `TrueNeg` folder as the field of view (64x64) is larger than what the program used to identify those thumbnails (just the centroids of single cells at the center of that thumbnail).    \n",
    "  \n",
    "While you are manually sorting the postives and negative thumbnails, please keep in mind that you are looking for high-confident positives and high-confident negatives. It is absolutely okay to delete off majority of the thumbnails that you are not confident about. This infact makes it easy and fast as you are looking to only keep only thumbnails that are readily sortable.  \n",

    "Lastly, I generally use a whole slide image to generate these thumbnails as there will be enough regions with high expression and no expression of the marker of interest. If you look at the thumbnails of this dummy example, you will notice that most thumbnails of `TrueNeg` for `ECAD` does contain some level of `ECAD` as there is not enough regions to sample from. "

This parameter essentially creates a mirror duplicate copy of all the thumbnails and saves it under a folder named `localNorm`. The difference being that each thumbnail is normalized to the maximum intensity pixel in that thumbnail. It helps to visually sort out the true positives and negatives faster and more reliably. As we will not use the thumbnails in the `localNorm` for training the deep learning model, we want to make sure all the manual sorting that we did in the `localNorm` folder is copied over to the real training data.
